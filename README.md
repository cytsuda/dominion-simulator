## "Dominion Card Game" Simulator

# The Idea

Make a board game simulator to my card game called "Dominion" (temporary title).
The game rules are still a work in progress.
The main idea for a V1 is to make a online board open to interactions similar to Dueling Book in Yu-Gi-Oh, where the players have total control of the interaction of the game and the social contract of the game rules will made them play fair, similar to a any non-digital boardgame.
